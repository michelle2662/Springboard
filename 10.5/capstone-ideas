# 🧑‍⚕️ Capstone Project Idea: CareConnect – A Collaborative App for Caregivers

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Millions of people care for aging parents, disabled family members, or chronically ill loved ones—but most do it without proper tools. From keeping track of medications and doctor visits to coordinating between siblings or healthcare aides, caregiving can quickly become overwhelming.

**CareConnect** is a full-stack web application designed to centralize and simplify caregiving. It helps families manage and collaborate on their loved one’s care through a shared digital dashboard.

## 💡 Project Overview

**CareConnect** is a collaborative healthcare app for caregivers. Users can manage multiple care profiles (e.g. Mom, Dad, Partner), track medications, appointments, notes, tasks, and share updates securely with others involved in care.
